# 💬 OpenAI Agents SDK + Chainlit — My Learning Journey

This repository documents my practical learning and experiments with the **OpenAI Agents SDK**, using **Chainlit** to build simple chatbot interfaces from scratch.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- 🧠 My very first OpenAI agent using tools and functions  
- 💬 Chainlit-based chatbot interfaces to test and interact  
- 🔧 Custom tools for agents to call and reason with  
- 📘 Notes, code, and errors I learned from along the way  
- 🧪 Real experiments — not just copy-paste tutorials

---

## 📌 Focus Areas

- Basics of OpenAI Agents SDK  
- Registering tools for agents to use  
- Connecting agents with Chainlit frontend  
- Observing how agents reason and respond to tasks  
- Building intuition on tool calling and workflows

---

## 🛠️ Why Chainlit?

I used **Chainlit** to easily test agent behavior in a **conversational UI**, without having to build a full web app. It made it easier to:

- Quickly prototype and test agents  
- Interact with tools visually  
- Understand how agents reason through tasks step by step  

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

- Track my progress from beginner to intermediate  
- Document what I learned in a hands-on way  
- Share working examples of agent + tool + Chainlit integration  
- Reflect my **own experience** and understanding — not copy-paste

---

## ⚠️ Note

This is a **learning and practice repo** — not a production-level implementation. Things may be rough, experimental, or change over time as I keep learning.
